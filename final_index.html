				<p>	
					The after-school program runs on weekdays 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm.
					It is an exciting way to keep kids busy and entertained while gaining valuable life skills 
					and exercise.  It will teach kids about discipline, respect, perseverance, and invaluable self-defense skills. 
					Typical Taekwondo routines involve stretching, kicking and punching exercises, and practicing proper form and demonstrations. 
					In addition to traditional Taekwondo routines, our program will give the kids a chance to make long lasting friendship with their peers 
					through extracurricular activities like soccer, parkour, dodgeball and team building exercises.
